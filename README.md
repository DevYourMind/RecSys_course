# RecSys course
The course on recommender systems conducted in National Research University - Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia). Academic year 2021-2022. 

Course on recommender systems.

Week1
-----
- Examples of RecSys models in production.
- Formalization of the ranking (recommender systems) task (2 popular types of tasks, 2 types of data sets). 
- Ranking functions (BPR, WARP, RankNET, LambdaRank, LambdaMART).
- Metrics for the quality estimation (Hitrate, Precision @ k, Recall @ k, AP@k, MAP@l, DCG@k, NDCG@k).
- Taxonomy of RecSys approaches ([MF, FM, CF & other general], Content-based [including knowledge graph based, GB for ranking], Context-based, Sequential based, RL, Hybrid [including two-level cascade, blending]).
- Pros / Cons of current approaches.
- Review of the main future directions.
- Problems of the current articles.
- Recommended sources on RecSys.
